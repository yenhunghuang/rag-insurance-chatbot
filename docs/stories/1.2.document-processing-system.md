### Data Models

Based on architecture requirements [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#models]:

**Document Model Structure (src/models.py)**:

```python
@dataclass
class Document:
    content: str                    # Chunk text content
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]        # Source and chunk metadata

### File Locations

Based on project structure requirements [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:

**Source Code Files**:

```
src/processing/
├── document_processor.py      # Main processing class
├── text_cleaner.py           # Text cleaning utilities
└── chunking_strategy.py      # Chunking logic implementation

data/processed/chunks.json           # Processed document chunks
data/processed/metadata.json         # Chunk metadata and statistics
```

### Technical Constraints

Technology stack requirements [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:

**Python Dependencies**:

-   **pandas**: For structured data manipulation and CSV/JSON operations
-   **sentence-transformers**: For Chinese text tokenization compatibility
-   **pyyaml**: For configuration file processing if needed

**Processing Configuration** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#configuration-management]:

```python
@dataclass
class ProcessingConfig:
    chunk_size: int = 256
    chunk_overlap: int = 26
    max_document_size: int = 10_000_000  # 10MB limit
    supported_formats: List[str] = field(default_factory=lambda: ['.txt'])
    preserve_metadata: bool = True
```

**Security Configuration** [New requirement for Task 7]:

```python
@dataclass
class SecurityConfig:
    max_file_size: int = 10_000_000  # 10MB limit per file
    allowed_file_extensions: List[str] = field(default_factory=lambda: ['.txt'])
    enable_pii_detection: bool = True
    pii_masking_patterns: List[str] = field(default_factory=lambda: [
        r'\d{4}-\d{4}-\d{4}-\d{4}',  # Credit card patterns
        r'\d{10,11}',                # Phone numbers

    ])
    max_memory_per_document: int = 500_000_000  # 500MB memory limit
    enable_security_logging: bool = True
```

**Security Implementation Patterns** [Required for Task 7]:

-   **PII Detection**: Regex-based detection for common Taiwan insurance PII patterns
-   **Resource Limits**: Memory and processing time limits per document
-   **Audit Logging**: Security events logged with timestamps and document hashes

**Performance Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#performance-characteristics]:

-   **Processing Speed**: ~100 documents/second for small files (<1MB)
-   **Memory Usage**: <2GB peak for large document processing
