## Story

**As a** Developer,  
**I want** to establish the foundational project structure and core infrastructure,  
**so that** I can efficiently develop the RAG insurance chatbot with proper architecture and development standards.

### Testing Requirements

Based on testing strategy [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]:

-   Testing framework: pytest with async support
-   Test organization: unit (70%), integration (20%), e2e (10%)
-   Test file naming: test\_\*.py pattern
-   Test coverage target: ≥80% for unit tests
-   Test fixtures in tests/conftest.py for shared test equipment
-   Test categories with markers: @pytest.mark.unit, @pytest.mark.integration, @pytest.mark.e2e

### Technical Constraints

Technology stack requirements [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:

-   **Runtime**: Python 3.8+
-   **Package Management**: pip + requirements.txt
-   **Code Quality**: Black (formatter) + Flake8 (linter)
-   **Environment Management**: python-venv + .env
-   **Containerization**: Docker with multi-stage builds
-   **Configuration**: dataclass-based with python-dotenv

### Testing

#### Test File Location

-   Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_*.py`
-   Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_*.py`
-   E2E tests: `tests/e2e/test_*.py`
-   Test configuration: `tests/conftest.py`

#### Test Standards

Following coding standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]:

-   Use pytest framework with async support (pytest-asyncio)
-   Test coverage ≥80% using pytest-cov
-   AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) for test structure
-   Mock external dependencies in unit tests
-   Use fixtures for shared test setup

#### Testing Frameworks and Patterns

-   **Core Framework**: pytest with plugins (pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov)
-   **Mocking**: unittest.mock for dependency isolation
-   **Test Data**: fixtures in conftest.py for reusable test data
-   **Test Categories**: Marked tests (@pytest.mark.unit, @pytest.mark.integration, @pytest.mark.e2e)

#### Specific Testing Requirements

For this foundational story:

-   Test configuration loading and validation
-   Test exception handling and logging setup
-   Test Docker container builds successfully
-   Test code quality tools run without errors
-   Verify all project directories are created correctly
